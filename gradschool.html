      <h1 >
       About: 
      </h1>

      <p>
        Project REMiX is the culmination of my creative software development internship as a UNCF Disney Scholar at Imagineering Research and Development, and it's all about remixing Disney's Parks classic experiences and attractions through a Black cultural lens. 

        Together with my mentor, Jonathan Becker, we envisioned Project REMiX as a large-scale concept that introduces a fresh storytelling experience while staying true to the source material. Our goal is to diversify the Disney Park experience beyond the familiar IPs like Princess and the Frog, Black Panther, or Lion King. We believe in reinventing these classic experiences from the ground up, paying homage to our beloved past and celebrating our diverse future. </p>

          <p>One captivating aspect of Project REMiX is the Electric Block Party, a proof of concept inspired by the Main Street Electrical Parade. In this concept, we focus on creating a dynamic and reactive marching band costume, drawing inspiration from the vibrant rhythms of HBCU marching bands and Black Mardi Gras. Imagine a costume with fiber optic cables braided with ball-balls, reminiscent of unique Black hairstyles. 

            What makes this costume truly special is its connection to music. As a flute player, I wanted the LED lights to respond to the music I played. We mapped the lights to musical notes, creating a dynamic and electric visual experience. The colors and patterns change with each note, providing a captivating display that mirrors the energy and style of Black music and dance. </p>

              <p>Throughout Project REMiX, we explored key cultural touchstones of the Black experience, including, but not limited to, music, fashion, and the importance of unity. We wanted to showcase the diversity within the Black community and bring that richness to Disney Park attractions. 

                In essence, Project REMiX is driven by the belief that everyone deserves to see themselves in the park. As the Disney Parks brand expands into communities that historically have been less likely to participate, it's crucial that our attractions remain relevant, exciting, and inspirational to all guests. </p>
     
    

      <h1 >
       Development Process: 
      </h1>
      <p>
        1. Conceptualization: Jonathan and I discussed the idea of remixing Disney Park experiences from a Black cultural perspective, with a specific focus on the Main Street Electrical Parade.</p>
        
        <p>2. Research: I conducted extensive research on key cultural touchstones of the Black experience, identifying patterns and categories related to music, fashion, and community.</p>
        
          <p>3. Prototyping in Virtual Reality: I utilized virtual reality to prototype potential costume looks, exploring different lighting patterns around a human avatar in the Unity game engine to visually capture the essence of Black energy and style.</p>
        
            <p>4. Fiber Optic LED Dress Concept: Inspired by fashion designers using fiber optic cables for LED dresses, Jonathan and I decided to incorporate this concept into our costume. Jonathan box-braided fiber optic cables and added ball-balls to create organic lighting effects reminiscent of unique Black hairstyles. Notably, this internship was conducted remotely during the COVID-19 lockdown, with Jonathan shipping materials to me for collaboration. </p>
        
              <p>5. Mapping Lights to Musical Notes: To create dynamic and electric lighting, Jonathan suggested mapping the lights to musical notes. Using a microcontroller, microphone, pressure sensor, and LEDs integrated with my flute, I mapped color patterns to different flute notes. </p>
        
                <p>6. Technical Prototyping: I prototyped the microcontroller, microphone, pressure sensor, and LEDs to understand the technical aspects. This involved mapping out piano key visuals as a guide and reinterpreting piano keys with actual LEDs. </p>
        
                  <p>7. Building the Prototype Costume: After technical prototyping, we transitioned to building the physical prototype costume, integrating box-braided fiber optic cables, ball-balls, LED animation, and music-triggered lighting effects. </p>
        
                    <p>8. Performance Testing: I conducted a rough proof-of-concept video to showcase how the prototype costumes could look during a performance, demonstrating the dynamic and vibrant effects in action. </p>
        
                      <p>9. Presentation: I concluded the project with a presentation, sharing insights, experiences, and the outcomes of my creative software development internship.  </p>

      </h1>

      <p>

        In March 2021, Games for Change hosted the week-long "Cross-Cultural Impact Gam Jam." I collaborated with Ashley Sarah Eliassaint and Saneliso "Sunny" Dube to create a narrative role-playing game, "On the Flip Side," using Yarn Spinner in Unity. This innovative tool allowed us to seamlessly build branching narratives and dialogues, earning our game an Honorable Mention for its exploration of diverse Black voices.     </p>
        
        <p>Yarn Spinner proved to be an invaluable asset, offering writers an easy-to-use platform with powerful features to integrate content directly into our game. Despite the challenges of remote collaboration during the pandemic, our team successfully leveraged Yarn Spinner to craft a rich and engaging experience that challenges the monolithic perception of Black voices.     </p>
        
          <p>The Honorable Mention recognizes the impact of "On the Flip Side" and highlights the importance of tools like Yarn Spinner in empowering creators to amplify underrepresented voices in the gaming industry. The game invites players to explore the multiplicity of voices within the broader context of the Black experience. 
      </p>

       Development Process: 
      </h1>
      <p>
        Our journey with "On the Flip Side" during the Cross-Cultural Impact Game Jam unfolded amid the challenges of our college environment transitioning to remote work. With time constraints looming, our three-person team dedicated ourselves to the task, recognizing the importance of addressing stereotypes within the Black community.   </p>

        <p> In the initial phase, we selected Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing" for its ability to highlight diverse perspectives and showcase how people perceive the world in different lights. Building on this inspiration, our scripts were crafted to capture the richness of individual experiences, embodied by our main characters: Irvin, Jelani, and Amandla. My responsibilities centered around script production, finding sprites, and programming.   </p>
        
          <p>As we delved into learning Yarn Spinner, our scriptwriting efforts aimed to bring depth to the narrative. The final days saw us navigating the complexities of remote programming. Despite the time pressures and the inevitable presence of errors, such as the missing apostrophe in the picture, our team persevered.  </p>
        
            <p>Presenting our creation at the Cross-Cultural Impact Game Jam, we acknowledged its imperfections but celebrated the dedication and effort poured into "On the Flip Side." The recognition, in the form of an Honorable Mention, validated our commitment to challenging stereotypes and promoting inclusivity through the powerful medium of gaming.

          <h1>About:</h1>
          <p >
            During my year abroad as an English teacher at Daegu Foreign Language High School, my co-teacher Bethany Lor and I embarked on an inspiring project named "Project: UN Sustainable Goals." Motivated by the desire to provide our advanced students with a global education and encourage them to think about the experiences of others worldwide, we chose to focus on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).    </p>

           <p > Our approach involved weekly comprehensive lessons, incorporating both individual and group activities to ensure a detailed understanding of the SDGs. Homework assignments and quizzes were employed to reinforce their learning. The pinnacle of the project was a final group assignment where students collaborated in teams to devise 2-3 unique and thoughtful solutions addressing an SDG of their choice. 
            The challenge resulted in a presentation to the class, conducted entirely in English.    </p>
           
            <p >  Despite the difficulty of the task, our students rose to the occasion, passing with flying colors and showcasing the power of a global education. The SDG website aptly describes these goals as a call to action to transform our world by ending poverty and inequality, protecting the planet, and ensuring health, justice, and prosperity for all. Our project aimed to instill in our students the importance of leaving no one behind, fostering a sense of responsibility towards a more sustainable and equitable future.
            </p>
    

    
            <h1 >
              Development Process:
             </h1>
       
          <p>

            The development process of "Project: UN Sustainable Goals" was a dynamic and collaborative journey as Bethany Lor and I co-taught the course. Our teaching approach involved a unique rotation, where each week, one of us took the lead in delivering the lesson while the other supported.
             </p>
            
            <p >Our responsibilities extended beyond traditional teaching methods. We were individually accountable for creating engaging and informative slides covering the SDGs 
              of the week, as well as designing activities that actively involved the students. To make the lessons more relatable,
              we incorporated elements such as TV shows and current music, creating a fun and relevant learning environment.   </p>
            
              <p >Active student engagement didn't end in the classroom. We consistently reviewed student feedback and homework assignments to gauge their progress. This iterative feedback loop allowed us to tailor our teaching approach and address any challenges the students faced. Additionally, we took on the responsibility of grading the final group projects, giving us complete control over the class structure.   </p>
            
                <p >This experience marked my first time teaching in such a capacity, presenting a significant learning curve. However, Bethany played a crucial role as a mentor, sharing insights and guidance that enriched my teaching skills. The collaborative nature of our teaching partnership not only facilitated the success of the project but also served as a valuable professional development experience for both of us.
